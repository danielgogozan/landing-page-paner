### `Latest`
# **Version 1.0**
With Paner, you can plan and organise your grocery lists fast & easy. Move your list from the fridge door directly to your pocket or to your pockets, because you can build it with whomever you wish, in realtime. Never worry about tracking your financials, as every cost is automatically tracked and converted into visual charts so that you can continue making right decisions in the future. Besides, it also generates a product categories distribution pie to identify the product types you consume most frequently. 

Planning means reducing food waste, saving time and money. Paner can help you do that.
